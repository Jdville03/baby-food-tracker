# num-num time!

Moms, dads, family members, nannies, and other caregivers can use this Sinatra app to track the feedings and growth of their babies. Tracking every aspect of an infant's life (including diapers and sleep) can be tedious. If your baby is past that stage, this app allows you to focus on logging your little one's adventures with food! You can also record your baby's height and/or weight as frequently as you would like.

## Usage

Visit the app at https://num-num-time.herokuapp.com/. Sign up to get started. Add a baby to track by creating a new baby profile or finding an existing baby profile created by another caregiver. Navigate the site to add, edit, and delete meal and height/weight entries for each of your babies.
